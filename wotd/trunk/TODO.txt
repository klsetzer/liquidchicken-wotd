<!-- To Do, Wishlist, etc. {{{2
To Do:
    0) handle multiple wotd
    1) Need to conquer multiple queries for QOTD
    2) count multiple wotd and multiple previous wotd separately
    3) Separate positioning CSS from styling CSS
	4) Get working with jsapi key??
    5) Popup to configure timing and sources !!!Started
    6) after #6, produce several themes
    8) update calendar icon with today's date
    9) vary element positioning for screen-saver-like appearance
	A) Each panel should have its own timer
    B) _run() call will reload feed.  How do I gracefully do a javascript reload once in a while?
    C) Panels with lots of content should block-center fill instead of just center (like previousCount=10)
    D) Fix buttons now that textfill resize works

Done:
    *) js loading optimization via google.load CDN
Panel Types:
    . wotd
    . previous
    . qotd
    . announce
